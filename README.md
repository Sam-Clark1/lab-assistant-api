# Lab Assistant Back End
## Description
I work as a Research Associate in a lab for a biotech company, and I make use of many chemistry calculations in my career. It was becoming difficult to keep track of all the formulas I use so I decided to make this website where they are all in once place and easily accessible. Since its creation, this website has aided me and a number of colleagues in generating real data that has been presented to customers in a faster and more efficient way. <br>
This repository is for the back end of the website which is Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL.
